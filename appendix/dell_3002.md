## Processing capacity

Supports concurrent processing of 3000 data tags per second.

In real cases, the edge does not need to ingest and process data tags for all acquisition points every second. Therefore, this model could support ingestion of about 5000 data tags in most cases. Contact Envision EnOS Support for detailed consultation.
